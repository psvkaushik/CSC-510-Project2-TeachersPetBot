## Case Study

We have implemented following functionalites across multiple platforms and tested. Following are the case studies:

1. Custom profanity settings
   Users entering NSFW messages can be warned, timed out, or banned based on instructor-defined or default settingsâ€”warning, timeout, followed by server ban.

2. Persistent Block from server
   Banned users remain blocked; when the bot restarts, attempting reentry leads to an automatic kick if the bot is offline. Online attempts are barred.

3. Instructor Mentions Channel  
   Tagging instructors results in questions being posted in the instructor QNA channel; replies are posted back to the main channel, ensuring no mention goes
   unnoticed.

4. DB initialization
   Proper integration with databases ensures new user entry upon bot restart; detects and creates missing user database entries on server join.

5. Spam Violation penalty
   Users receive a 10XP penalty for spamming, enhancing the XP-based ranking system, and receiving timeouts for improper behavior.

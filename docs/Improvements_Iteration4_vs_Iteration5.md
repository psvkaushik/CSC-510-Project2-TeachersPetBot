| Spam Penalty                 | Each user gets some points for sending a message which increases the XP and at each 100 XP it goes up a rank. | However, they were never penalized for improper behavior. Now if the user spams, they get a penalty of 10xp. Along with getting timeouts.                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

| Persistent Block from server | Not implemented                                                                                               | If a user is banned and kicked out from the server they remain blocked, if they try to join the server when the bot is not running, it will kick them out when the bot starts up. If they try to join again when the bot is running, it will not let them join the server.                                                                                       |

In the initialization phase, we have even set up to detect all the users in the server and make database entries for each user whose entry does not exist                                  |

It will help ensure that no mention goes unnoticed as all the messages are available to see at one glance with no clutter in a separate channel. |
